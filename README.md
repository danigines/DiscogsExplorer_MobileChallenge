# Discogs API Integration Guide

To integrate with the Discogs API in your iOS project, follow these steps to authenticate and obtain an API token:

## Steps to Generate an Authentication Token

1. **Create a Discogs Account**  
   If you don't have one, sign up at [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/register).

2. **Create an Application**  
   - Log in to your Discogs account.
   - Navigate to [Discogs Developer's Page](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers).
   - Create an application and get your **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret**.

3. **Authenticate and Get the Token**  
   - Use OAuth 2.0 to authenticate with Discogs and get your **access token**.  
   - This involves sending a request to the Discogs OAuth endpoint to get a token.  
   - For more details on OAuth, check the official [Discogs API Documentation](https://www.discogs.com/developers/#authentication).

4. **Use the Token**  
   Once you have your authentication token, you'll need to add it to your project. Open the `APIEnvironment.swift:12` file and locate the following line of code:
   ```swift
   static let apiToken: String = "MY_DISCOGS_TOKEN" // ‚Üê Replace with your actual Discogs token
   ```
   Replace the placeholder `"MY_DISCOGS_TOKEN"` with the token you generated from your **Discogs account**.

   For example, if your _token_ is **`N7HSIVqLldbWWtHLMyWrrCldEKwhUQOrnbr1mWra`**, your code should look like this:
   ```swift
   static let apiToken: String = "N7HSIVqLldbWWtHLMyWrrCldEKwhUQOrnbr1mWra"
   ```
   Make sure to keep the token safe and avoid sharing it publicly.


# ‚úÖ Static Analysis

Using [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to enforce style and linting rules.
1. **Install SwiftLint**  
   If you have _Homebrew_, open your _Terminal_ and run:
   ```bash
   brew install swiftlint
   ```
   ‚úÖ Once installed, verify it with:
   ```bash
   swiftlint version
   ```
   You should see something like:
   ```bash
   0.59.1
   ```
2. **Navigate to Your Project Director**  
   - Move to.
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/DiscogsExplorer
   ```
   - Or, if you're in the root of your repo:
   ```bash
   cd DiscogsExplorer
   ```

3. **Run SwiftLint in the Console**  
   - In the root of your project, run: 
   ```bash
   swiftlint
   ```
   - You‚Äôll see output like:
   ```bash
   Sources/ViewModels/SearchViewModel.swift:42:1: warning: Force Unwrapping Violation: Force unwrapping should be avoided. (force_unwrapping)
   Tests/SearchViewModelTests.swift:15: warning: Line Length Violation: Line should be 120 characters or less (currently 134). (line_length)
   ```
   - These are warnings or errors based on your `.swiftlint.yml` file.
